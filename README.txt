# Integer-Sequence-Learning
	Extracting the latent parameters of a sequence using Baum Welch Algorithm and predicting the next element in the sequence using the latent variables learnt


#Run the following command to run the project. python 2.7 is required.

	python project.py

#The dataset is taken from the Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/integer-sequence-learning.
