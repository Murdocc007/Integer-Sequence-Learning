# Integer-Sequence-Learning
Extracting the latent parameters of a sequence using Baum Welch Algorithm and predicting the next element in the sequence using the latent variables learnt


The dataset is taken from the Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/integer-sequence-learning.

More details about the Baum Welch Algortihm can be found https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/courses/inlp2004a/lect10-hmm2.pdf.
A fantastic tutorial has been provided of the forward backward algorithm here ->https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zDARfKVm7s
